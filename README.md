# EcoIrrigation

***The following page is being writting and constently updating***

EcoIrrigation is a small electronic module which allow you to convert the electrical resistance signal of a Watermak sensors to a humdidy value (kPa).

## Watermark sensor
Watermarkâ„¢ sensors are available from Irrometer Company. These soil moisture sensors are to be buried in intimate contact with soil at root depth, where they will reach equilibrium with the local soil moisture. The measurement correlates well with soil water potential. This is fine for agriculture, because water potential (in units of kilo-Pascal or centibar) best quantifies the work plant roots do to extract moisture from the soil.


## Library and PCB
The library for Arduino board and the PCB, will be available in the next few months. Wainting for this time, you can follow my activities on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ecosensors) or to read my [project](https://eco-sensors.ch/smart-irrigation/) with LoRaWAN.

/*
 * EcoIrrigation from EcoSensors
 * 
 * Here is an exemple how to read a value of WATERMARK sensor with the EcoBoard board
 * IMPORTANT: The watermark sensor must be powered only during a measure. Then keep it unpowered.
 * 
 * The EcoBoard has a GPIO Port Expander (PCF8574) and a MOSFET to power the Watermark sensor. The MOSFET-P is trigget by P1 or P2 or P3 (Pin 1,2 or 3 of the PCF8574).
